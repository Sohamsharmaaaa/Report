## **Q1. Explain how to create a key pair for accessing your EC2 instance. What is the purpose of the key pair, and how does it enhance the security of your instance?**

**[15 Marks]**

A **key pair** in AWS EC2 is used to securely connect to your instance without using a password. It consists of two parts – a **public key** that AWS stores, and a **private key** that you download and keep safe. This system uses asymmetric encryption to ensure that only the user who holds the private key can access the EC2 instance.

### **Steps to Create a Key Pair**

1. Log in to the **AWS Management Console** and open the **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. From the left-hand side panel, select **“Key Pairs”** under the *Network & Security* section.
3. Click on **“Create Key Pair”**.
4. Enter a name for your key pair (for example, `mykeypair`).
5. Choose the **key type** (RSA or ED25519).
6. Select the private key file format as `.pem` (for Linux or Mac) or `.ppk` (for Windows PuTTY users).
7. Click on **“Create Key Pair”**. The private key file will automatically download to your system.
8. Save this file securely and change its permission using the command:

   ```bash
   chmod 400 mykeypair.pem
   ```
9. When launching an EC2 instance, select this key pair in the **Key Pair (login)** section.

### **Purpose of the Key Pair**

The key pair is used for secure authentication to your EC2 instance. Instead of passwords, AWS uses the public-private key model to verify identity. This ensures that only someone with the private key can log in to the instance.

### **How It Enhances Security**

* It eliminates the need for password-based logins, preventing brute-force attacks.
* The private key never leaves your local machine, ensuring it cannot be intercepted.
* Even if someone gets access to the public key, they cannot connect without the private key.
* Access can be revoked or rotated by simply replacing the key pair.
* It provides strong cryptographic protection and ensures only authorized users can access the instance.

In short, the key pair acts like a digital lock and key system, ensuring that your EC2 instance can only be accessed securely by trusted users.

## **Q2. For security reasons, you want to limit SSH access to your EC2 instance to only your office IP address. How would you modify the inbound rules of your security group to achieve this? What steps would you follow to ensure that only your office IP address can connect via SSH?**

**[15 Marks]**

### **Objective**

The main goal is to restrict SSH (port 22) access so that only connections from your **office IP address** are allowed and all other SSH attempts are blocked.

### **Steps to Modify Inbound Rules**

1. Log in to the **AWS Management Console** and open the **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. From the left panel, select **“Security Groups”**.
3. Choose the **Security Group** that is attached to your EC2 instance.
4. Go to the **Inbound Rules** tab and click on **“Edit inbound rules”**.
5. Modify or add a new rule for SSH:

   * Type: SSH
   * Protocol: TCP
   * Port Range: 22
   * Source: Choose **My IP** (AWS automatically detects your current IP address) or manually enter your office IP, for example `203.145.22.178/32`.
     The `/32` indicates a single IP address.
6. Click on **Save rules** to apply the changes.

### **Verification Steps**

1. Try connecting to your instance from your **office network** using:

   ```bash
   ssh -i mykeypair.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
   ```

   The connection should be successful.
2. Try connecting from another network (for example, your mobile hotspot). The connection should be denied, confirming that only your office IP can access it.

### **Security Benefits (Explained in Points)**

1. It limits SSH access to a specific trusted network (your office).
2. It prevents unauthorized users from attempting to connect from unknown IPs.
3. It reduces the attack surface by blocking all SSH requests from outside your organization.
4. It helps in protecting the server from brute-force and port-scanning attacks.
5. It ensures that administrative access is only available from a secure, controlled location.

### **Conclusion**

By allowing SSH access only from your office IP, you effectively “whitelist” your trusted network. This setup strengthens the network-level security of your EC2 instance, ensuring that only authorized systems can establish a secure connection.

## **Q2. How do you create an IAM policy that grants full access to EC2 instances but only allows starting and stopping instances?**

**[15 Marks]**

An **IAM (Identity and Access Management) policy** in AWS defines permissions that control what actions users or roles can perform on specific resources. In this case, we want to allow users to **start and stop EC2 instances only**, and restrict all other EC2 operations.

---

### **Steps to Create the IAM Policy**

1. **Login to the AWS Management Console.**
   Go to the **IAM** service from the console.

2. **Open the “Policies” section.**
   In the navigation pane, click **Policies** → **Create Policy**.

3. **Select the “JSON” tab** to write a custom policy.

4. **Enter the JSON policy code** as shown below:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:StartInstances",
                "ec2:StopInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

5. **Explanation of Policy:**

   * `"Version": "2012-10-17"` specifies the policy language version.
   * `"Effect": "Allow"` means these actions are permitted.
   * `"Action"` defines which operations the user can perform — in this case, starting, stopping, and describing EC2 instances.
   * `"Resource": "*"` applies the policy to all EC2 instances in the account.

6. **Review and Create the Policy.**

   * Click on **Next: Tags** → **Next: Review**.
   * Give the policy a name like **EC2StartStopPolicy** and add a description.
   * Click **Create Policy**.

7. **Attach the Policy to a User or Role.**
   Go to **Users → Permissions → Add permissions → Attach existing policies directly**, select the policy you created, and click **Add permissions**.

---

### **Result**

The assigned IAM user will be able to:

* Start EC2 instances
* Stop EC2 instances
* View instance details

They will **not** be able to terminate instances, create new ones, or modify configurations.

---

### **Conclusion**

By creating a custom IAM policy with limited EC2 permissions, you enforce the principle of **least privilege**, ensuring that users have only the exact permissions needed for their task — in this case, starting and stopping EC2 instances — while maintaining overall cloud security.

---

## **Q2. You want to ensure that your EC2 instance’s data is backed up regularly. What methods would you use to back up data from your EC2 instance? Discuss options such as creating snapshots of EBS volumes and using AWS Backup.**

**[15 Marks]**

---

### **1. Backing Up Using EBS Snapshots**

Every EC2 instance stores its data on **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** volumes. A **snapshot** is a point-in-time copy of an EBS volume that can be used to restore data later.

**Steps to Create an EBS Snapshot:**

1. Go to the **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. Select **Volumes** from the navigation pane.
3. Choose the volume attached to your EC2 instance.
4. Click on **Actions → Create Snapshot**.
5. Enter a **Description** (for example, *Daily Backup of EC2 Volume*).
6. Click **Create Snapshot**.

The snapshot will appear under the **Snapshots** section. You can later use it to create a new volume or launch an instance with the same data.

**Advantages of EBS Snapshots:**

* Fast and incremental backups.
* Automatically stored in Amazon S3 for durability.
* Easy restoration of entire volumes.
* Can be automated using lifecycle policies.

---

### **2. Using AWS Backup Service**

**AWS Backup** is a fully managed service that automates and centralizes backups across AWS services, including EC2, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, and more.

**Steps to Use AWS Backup:**

1. Open the **AWS Backup Console**.
2. Click on **Create backup plan**.
3. Choose a **predefined plan** or create a **custom plan** with your preferred backup frequency (daily, weekly, etc.).
4. Add **resource assignments** – select your EC2 instance or EBS volume to back up.
5. Specify a **backup vault** (the storage location for backups).
6. Save and activate the plan.

AWS Backup will now automatically create backups of your EC2 data according to your schedule.

**Advantages of AWS Backup:**

* Centralized and automated backup management.
* Policy-based scheduling for multiple resources.

## slip 6

Here’s your **final practical exam answer** written in a clean, topper-style theoretical format — no unnecessary tables, just clear steps and explanations 👇

---

## **Q1. How can you create an IAM policy that allows only read access to S3 buckets?**

**[15 Marks]**

To create an IAM policy that provides **read-only access** to all S3 buckets, we define a policy that allows actions such as listing buckets and viewing objects but prevents any write or delete actions. This ensures that the user or role can only view and download data, not modify it.

### **Steps to Create the Read-Only IAM Policy:**

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console** and open the **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** service.
2. In the left navigation pane, select **Policies** and click **Create Policy**.
3. Choose the **JSON** tab to manually define the policy.
4. Enter the following JSON code:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:ListBucket"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::*/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
5. Click **Next**, give your policy a name (for example, `S3ReadOnlyAccessPolicy`), and then select **Create Policy**.
6. Now, go to **Users** or **Groups**, choose the one to which you want to assign this policy, click **Add Permissions**, and attach this custom policy.

### **Explanation:**

* The `"s3:ListBucket"` action allows viewing the list of objects inside any S3 bucket.
* The `"s3:GetObject"` action allows downloading or reading an object’s content.
* The `"Resource"` defines that the permissions apply to all S3 buckets and their contents.

### **Security Benefit:**

* It ensures that users cannot upload, modify, or delete any files — they only have view permissions.
* This is ideal for auditors, developers, or external partners who only need read access without risking accidental data modification.

---

## **Q2. Create multiple key-pairs and use same key-pair for multiple instances.**

**[15 Marks]**

### **Creating Multiple Key Pairs:**

1. Log in to the **AWS Management Console** and open the **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. In the navigation pane, click **Key Pairs** under **Network & Security**.
3. Click **Create Key Pair**, enter a name (e.g., `MyKeyPair1`), select key type (`RSA` or `ED25519`), and choose `.pem` for Linux or `.ppk` for Windows.
4. Download and securely store the private key file.
5. Repeat the process if you want to create additional key pairs (e.g., `MyKeyPair2`, `MyKeyPair3`).

### **Using the Same Key Pair for Multiple Instances:**

1. When launching new EC2 instances, in the **Key Pair (login)** section, select the **existing key pair** (e.g., `MyKeyPair1`).
2. Launch multiple instances using the same key pair.
3. You can now use the same private key file (`.pem` or `.ppk`) to connect to all those instances securely.

### **Best Practices and Benefits:**

* **Centralized Access:** Using one key pair across multiple instances simplifies SSH access management.
* **Security Management:** If a key pair is compromised, only the instances associated with that key are affected, making it easier to rotate or revoke keys.
* **Scalability:** Ideal for environments where multiple instances need to be managed by the same administrator or automation tool.

## **Q1. How do you configure Network Access to an instance using Security Groups?**

**[15 Marks]**

Security Groups in AWS act as **virtual firewalls** that control inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances. They are used to define what type of network communication is allowed to and from your instance.

### **Steps to Configure Network Access Using Security Groups:**

1. **Login to AWS Console** and open the **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. From the left-hand menu, select **Security Groups** under **Network & Security**.
3. Click **Create Security Group**.
4. Enter a **name**, **description**, and choose the **VPC** where your instance resides.
5. Under the **Inbound Rules**, specify what traffic should be allowed to reach your instance. For example:

   * **SSH (Port 22):** For Linux instance access using a key pair.
   * **RDP (Port 3389):** For Windows instance remote access.
   * **HTTP (Port 80) or HTTPS (Port 443):** For web server access.
6. You can specify the **Source IP range** using CIDR notation (for example, `0.0.0.0/0` for public access or a specific IP like `203.0.113.10/32` for restricted access).
7. Under **Outbound Rules**, define the allowed outgoing traffic (usually `All traffic` is allowed by default).
8. Click **Create Security Group**.
9. While launching or editing an EC2 instance, attach this security group to the instance.

### **Key Points:**

* Security groups are **stateful** — if you allow inbound traffic on a port, the corresponding outbound response is automatically allowed.
* You can **attach multiple security groups** to one instance, and an instance can belong to several groups for flexible access control.
* They help ensure that only trusted users and IP addresses can connect to your instance.

### **Security Benefit:**

By configuring security groups properly, you can control and monitor all allowed network communication to your EC2 instance, protecting it from unauthorized access and potential attacks.

---

## **Q2. You have a web server EC2 instance that needs to be secured from unauthorized access while allowing necessary traffic. How would you configure security groups to secure your EC2 instance? Describe the process for creating and applying security group rules to allow only HTTP and SSH traffic while restricting all other access.**

**[15 Marks]**

To secure your web server instance, you must allow only **essential traffic** (HTTP and SSH) and block everything else. This is achieved by configuring inbound and outbound rules in the Security Group.

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Open the EC2 Dashboard** and go to **Security Groups**.
2. Click **Create Security Group** and provide:

   * **Name:** `WebServer-SG`
   * **Description:** Security group for web server allowing HTTP and SSH only.
   * **VPC:** Select the same VPC as your EC2 instance.
3. Under **Inbound Rules**, click **Add Rule** and configure:

   * **Type:** SSH | **Protocol:** TCP | **Port:** 22 | **Source:** Your IP (e.g., `203.0.113.10/32`)
   * **Type:** HTTP | **Protocol:** TCP | **Port:** 80 | **Source:** `0.0.0.0/0` (to allow global web access)
4. Do **not** add any other inbound rules. This ensures that no other traffic (like FTP, SMTP, or custom ports) can access the instance.
5. Under **Outbound Rules**, keep **All traffic → 0.0.0.0/0** so the instance can make updates and reach the internet if required.
6. Click **Create Security Group**.
7. Attach this security group to your running EC2 instance via **Actions → Networking → Change Security Groups**.

### **Explanation:**

* **SSH (Port 22)** is needed for administrative remote access.
* **HTTP (Port 80)** is required for users to access your website.
* All other ports are blocked by default, protecting the instance from attacks such as brute-force or unauthorized scans.

### **Security Enhancement:**

* Restricting SSH to a **specific IP** prevents unauthorized remote access.
* Allowing only HTTP ensures that the instance serves only web traffic, reducing the risk of exposure.
* Since AWS Security Groups are **stateful**, any response traffic for allowed inbound requests is automatically permitted, ensuring seamless yet secure communication.

## **Q2. How do you configure AWS IAM policies for data access control?**

**[15 Marks]**

IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies define **permissions** that specify who can access which AWS resources and what actions they can perform.
Configuring IAM policies for **data access control** ensures that users and roles have only the minimum required permissions, following the **principle of least privilege**.

---

### **Steps to Configure IAM Policies for Data Access Control:**

1. **Login to the AWS Management Console.**

   * Go to the **IAM** service dashboard.

2. **Create a New Policy.**

   * In the left panel, click **Policies**, then **Create Policy**.

3. **Choose the Creation Method.**

   * Select the **JSON** tab to define permissions manually.

4. **Define Permissions in JSON Format.**
   Example: A policy that grants read-only access to a specific S3 bucket:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:ListBucket"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-data-bucket",
           "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-data-bucket/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Review and Create Policy.**

   * Click **Next**, give a name (e.g., `S3ReadOnlyAccess`), add a description, and then click **Create Policy**.

6. **Attach the Policy to Users, Groups, or Roles.**

   * Go to **Users** or **Roles** in IAM.
   * Choose the user or role → click **Add Permissions** → **Attach existing policies directly** → select your custom policy → **Add Permissions**.

7. **Test the Policy.**

   * Sign in as that IAM user to verify that the permissions work as intended (e.g., can view S3 data but cannot delete or upload).

---

### **Best Practices for Data Access Control:**

1. **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant only the permissions required for a user’s job.
2. **Use IAM Roles Instead of Root Credentials:** Roles are safer and more flexible.
3. **Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** Adds another security layer for sensitive data.
4. **Use Resource-Level Permissions:** Restrict policies to specific buckets, databases, or tables.
5. **Regularly Audit IAM Policies:** Review permissions to ensure compliance and security.

---

### **Conclusion:**

IAM policies provide **fine-grained control** over who can access data and how they can use it.
By configuring IAM policies properly, you protect your AWS resources from unauthorized access while enabling secure and efficient operations.

## **Q1. How do you add an SSH public key to an existing EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console?**

**[15 Marks]**

An SSH public key allows you to connect securely to your EC2 instance using key-based authentication instead of a password.
If you need to add a **new SSH public key** to an existing EC2 instance, you can do it by updating the authorized keys file or using the EC2 console and Systems Manager (for running commands remotely).

---

### **Steps to Add SSH Public Key to an Existing EC2 Instance:**

#### **Method 1: Using EC2 Instance Connect (Console Method)**

1. **Login to AWS Management Console.**

   * Open the **EC2 Dashboard**.

2. **Select the Instance.**

   * Go to **Instances** in the left menu.
   * Select the instance you want to access.

3. **Connect to Instance Using EC2 Instance Connect.**

   * Click the **Connect** button on the top.
   * Choose **EC2 Instance Connect (browser-based SSH)** → Click **Connect**.
   * You are now logged into the instance using temporary credentials.

4. **Add the New Public Key.**

   * Open the `authorized_keys` file using a text editor:

     ```bash
     sudo nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```
   * Paste the new SSH **public key** at the end of this file.
   * Save and exit the file.

5. **Adjust File Permissions.**

   * Ensure proper permissions using the commands:

     ```bash
     chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     chmod 700 ~/.ssh
     ```

6. **Exit and Test Connection.**

   * Exit the current session and try connecting to your instance from your local terminal using the corresponding private key:

     ```bash
     ssh -i "newkey.pem" ec2-user@<instance-public-ip>
     ```

---

### **Security Notes:**

* Never share your private key; only add **public keys** to instances.
* Ensure `.ssh` folder and files have **correct permissions** to avoid “Permission denied” errors.
* Delete old or unused keys regularly for better security.

---

### **Result:**

The new SSH public key is successfully added, and you can securely log in using the corresponding private key without modifying the instance’s launch configuration.

---

## **Q2. How does an IAM user go towards enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?**

**[15 Marks]**

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** adds an extra layer of security to your AWS account.
It requires users to provide two forms of authentication —

1. Their password (something they know), and
2. A one-time code from an MFA device (something they have).

This prevents unauthorized access even if a password is compromised.

---

### **Steps to Enable MFA for an IAM User:**

1. **Login to AWS Management Console** as the IAM user or as an administrator with permissions to manage MFA.

2. **Open the IAM Dashboard.**

   * In the AWS Console, search and open **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**.

3. **Go to Users.**

   * In the left-hand menu, click **Users**.
   * Select the IAM user for whom you want to enable MFA.

4. **Open Security Credentials Tab.**

   * Under the user details, select the **Security credentials** tab.

5. **Assign MFA Device.**

   * Under the **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** section, click **Assign MFA device**.

6. **Choose the Type of MFA Device.**
   AWS provides several options:

   * **Virtual MFA device** (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy)
   * **Hardware MFA device**
   * **FIDO2 security key**

   Most users select **Virtual MFA device**.

7. **Configure the MFA Device.**

   * Click **Continue** and open your MFA app on your phone.
   * Scan the QR code shown in the console.
   * The app will generate 6-digit authentication codes.

8. **Verify MFA.**

   * Enter two consecutive authentication codes from the app into the AWS Console fields.
   * Click **Assign MFA**.

9. **MFA Enabled Successfully.**

   * You will see the message **“MFA device assigned successfully.”**
   * Next time the user logs in, they must provide both their password and the MFA code.

---

### **Best Practices:**

* Always **enable MFA** for all root and IAM users.
* **Backup the MFA device setup** using recovery codes or a secondary device.
* Regularly **audit users** to ensure MFA remains active and enforced.

---

### **Security Benefit:**

MFA significantly strengthens account protection by requiring a second verification step, reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if login credentials are leaked or stolen.

* **Prevents Data Deletion**: Users cannot remove or modify bucket data.
* **Centralized Control**: Easily managed under IAM policies.

---

✅ **Result:**
User/group can **only view and download objects** from any S3 bucket, but **cannot upload, delete, or modify** any data.

---

---

**Q2. How would you create a security group to ensure your EC2 instance is accessible only through necessary ports (e.g., HTTP and SSH)? What inbound and outbound rules would you configure, and why? [10M]**

**Answer:**

To secure an EC2 instance and allow access only through HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22), you must configure a **Security Group** properly.

---

### **Step 1: Open EC2 Console**

1. Go to **Amazon EC2 Dashboard**.
2. In the left panel, select **Security Groups** → **Create Security Group**.

---

### **Step 2: Define Basic Details**

* **Security Group Name:** `WebServerSecurityGroup`
* **Description:** Allows only HTTP and SSH traffic
* **VPC:** Select your instance’s VPC.

---

### **Step 3: Configure Inbound Rules**

Add rules to **allow only required traffic:**

| Type | Protocol | Port Range | Source                           | Description       |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| SSH  | TCP      | 22         | Your IP (e.g., `203.0.113.0/24`) | Admin Access      |
| HTTP | TCP      | 80         | 0.0.0.0/0                        | Public Web Access |

✅ **Reasoning:**

* SSH (22) allows only administrators to connect.
* HTTP (80) allows public users to access the website.
* All other ports are blocked by default for security.

---

### **Step 4: Configure Outbound Rules**

| Type        | Protocol | Port Range | Destination | Description                                       |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| All Traffic | All      | All        | 0.0.0.0/0   | Allow instance to access internet updates or APIs |

✅ **Reasoning:**
Outbound traffic is usually allowed for updates or fetching web resources, but can be limited for tighter control.

---

### **Step 5: Apply Security Group**

1. During EC2 launch, under **Network settings**, choose **Select existing security group**.
2. Choose `WebServerSecurityGroup`.

---

## **Q2. Automate adding/removing SSH keys using AWS Systems Manager**

### **Steps:**

1. **Enable SSM Agent** on EC2 and attach IAM role with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`.
2. **Store SSH key** in **Parameter Store** as a string value.
3. Use **Run Command** in Systems Manager with a simple script:

   ```bash
   echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3..." >> /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```
4. To remove, run:

   ```bash
   sed -i '/ssh-rsa AAAAB3/d' /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

✅ **Result:** SSH keys are added or removed automatically from multiple instances — no manual login required.

## Slip 16

**Q1. Your EC2 instance needs to send outbound traffic to an external API but should not allow any other outbound traffic. How would you configure the outbound rules of your security group to permit only the necessary traffic? What considerations would you take into account for setting these rules? [15M]**

---

### **Answer:**

To restrict outbound traffic so that your EC2 instance can access only a specific external API, you must **customize the outbound rules** of the **Security Group**.

---

### **Steps to Configure Outbound Rules:**

1. **Open EC2 Dashboard → Security Groups → Select your Security Group.**
2. Go to the **Outbound rules** tab and click **Edit outbound rules.**
3. **Remove the default rule** that allows all outbound traffic (`0.0.0.0/0`).
4. **Add a new rule**:

   * **Type:** Custom TCP Rule (or HTTPS if the API uses HTTPS)
   * **Port Range:** As per the API (e.g., 443 for HTTPS)
   * **Destination:** Enter the **API’s public IP** or **CIDR block** (e.g., `203.0.113.10/32`).
5. Save changes.

---

### **Example Configuration:**

| Type  | Protocol | Port Range | Destination     |
| ----- | -------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| HTTPS | TCP      | 443        | 203.0.113.10/32 |

This allows the instance to send requests **only** to that API’s IP via HTTPS.

---

### **Key Considerations:**

1. **API IP Stability:**
   If the API uses multiple or dynamic IPs, use a **VPC endpoint** or **AWS PrivateLink** instead of static IP filtering.

2. **Security Principle:**
   Apply the **least privilege** — allow only required traffic and deny all others.

3. **Monitoring:**
   Enable **VPC Flow Logs** to verify outbound connections and detect unauthorized attempts.

4. **Testing:**
   Test connectivity after applying the rule to ensure API access still works.

---

✅ **Result:**
Your EC2 instance can access only the specific external API securely, while all other outbound traffic remains blocked.

---

---

**Q2. How does AWS handle connections when an EC2 instance is stopped and started again?**

---

### **Answer:**

When an **EC2 instance is stopped**, AWS releases certain resources and retains others depending on the configuration.

---

### **1. When Instance is Stopped:**

* **Compute resources (CPU & RAM)** are released.
* **Root EBS volume** and attached EBS volumes remain intact.
* **Public IPv4 address** is **released** (unless using an Elastic IP).
* **Private IP address** remains the same (within the same subnet).
* **Instance ID** remains unchanged.

---

### **2. When Instance is Started Again:**

* The instance **boots on new physical hardware.**
* A **new public IPv4 address** is assigned (unless an Elastic IP is attached).
* Existing **EBS volumes** are reattached automatically.
* All previously stored **data and configurations** on the EBS volumes remain.

---

### **Key Considerations:**

* Use **Elastic IP** if you need a permanent public IP.
* Ensure startup scripts or configurations handle any IP changes.
* If using DNS, update records automatically when IP changes.

**Q1. How do you restrict HTTP traffic to only a specific IP address or range in a Security Group? [15M]**

---

### **Answer:**

To restrict **HTTP (port 80)** traffic so only a specific IP or IP range can access your EC2 instance, you must configure **Inbound Rules** in the instance’s **Security Group**.

---

### **Steps to Configure:**

1. Open the **AWS Management Console → EC2 Dashboard.**
2. In the left menu, select **Security Groups.**
3. Choose the **Security Group** attached to your EC2 instance.
4. Go to the **Inbound Rules** tab → click **Edit Inbound Rules.**
5. Add a new rule:

   * **Type:** HTTP
   * **Protocol:** TCP
   * **Port Range:** 80
   * **Source:** The specific IP or CIDR range (e.g., `203.0.113.25/32` for one IP).
6. **Remove any 0.0.0.0/0 rule** to block public HTTP access.
7. Click **Save Rules.**

---

### **Example Rule:**

| Type | Protocol | Port Range | Source          |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| HTTP | TCP      | 80         | 203.0.113.25/32 |

This configuration allows only the IP `203.0.113.25` to access the web server over HTTP, blocking all others.

---

### **Key Considerations:**

* Use **/32** for a single IP or a **CIDR range** (e.g., `203.0.113.0/24`) for multiple addresses.
* Combine this with **HTTPS (port 443)** for secure web traffic.
* Regularly **review and update** IPs if they change.
* Always follow **least privilege** — only allow what’s absolutely necessary.

**Q2. How do you attach a policy to an IAM user using the AWS Management Console?**

---

### **Answer:**

Attaching a policy to an IAM user allows you to define what actions the user can perform on AWS resources.

---

### **Steps to Attach a Policy:**

1. **Login** to the **AWS Management Console.**
2. Go to the **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** service.
3. From the left sidebar, select **Users.**
4. Click on the **username** you want to assign permissions to.
5. Under the **Permissions** tab, click **Add Permissions.**
6. Choose **Attach policies directly.**
7. From the list, **select a policy** (e.g., `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` or your custom policy).
8. Click **Next → Add Permissions** to apply it.

---

### **Key Points:**

* Use **AWS-managed policies** for standard permissions.
* Use **custom policies (JSON)** for fine-grained control.
* Always follow the **principle of least privilege** — give only required access.

**Q1. How do you add an outbound rule to a Network ACL to block all traffic to the internet? [15M]**

---

### **Answer:**

A **Network ACL (Access Control List)** controls inbound and outbound traffic at the **subnet level** in a VPC.
To block all outbound traffic to the internet, you must create an **Outbound Deny rule** in your Network ACL.

---

### **Steps to Configure:**

1. **Open the AWS Management Console → VPC Dashboard.**
2. In the left navigation pane, click **Network ACLs.**
3. Select the **Network ACL** associated with your subnet.
4. Go to the **Outbound Rules** tab → click **Edit outbound rules.**
5. **Delete any existing “Allow All” rule** (e.g., Rule #100 with `0.0.0.0/0`).
6. Add a new rule with the following details:

   * **Rule Number:** 100
   * **Type:** All Traffic
   * **Protocol:** All
   * **Port Range:** All
   * **Destination:** `0.0.0.0/0`
   * **Allow/Deny:** **DENY**
7. Save the rule.

---

### **Example Configuration:**

| Rule # | Type        | Protocol | Port Range | Destination | Action |
| ------ | ----------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 100    | All Traffic | All      | All        | 0.0.0.0/0   | DENY   |

---

### **Key Considerations:**

* **Network ACLs are stateless** – you must configure both inbound and outbound rules properly.
* Rules are processed in **ascending order** — the first match decides the outcome.
* Blocking outbound traffic also prevents software updates, external API calls, or file uploads.

---

✅ **Result:**
All outbound traffic from the subnet to the internet is blocked, ensuring complete outbound isolation for security or compliance purposes.

**Q2. How do you create an IAM policy that denies all access to a specific S3 bucket?**

---

### **Answer:**

To restrict all access — including read, write, and list operations — to a specific S3 bucket, you can create an **IAM policy** that explicitly **denies** all actions on that bucket.

---

### **Steps to Create the Policy:**

1. Go to the **AWS Management Console → IAM → Policies.**
2. Click **Create Policy → JSON** tab.
3. Enter the following JSON code:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-secure-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

4. Click **Next**, name the policy (e.g., `DenyAccessToMyBucket`), and click **Create Policy.**
5. Attach this policy to the user, group, or role you want to restrict.

---

### **Key Points:**

* `"Effect": "Deny"` explicitly overrides all “Allow” permissions.
* The `"Resource"` field targets the specific bucket and all its objects.
* Use this for **sensitive or private data** where access must be restricted at all levels.
