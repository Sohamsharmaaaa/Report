### Q1 Conduct a risk assessment for an organization using ISO/IEC 27005 and create a risk management report.
Answer:
ISO/IEC 27005:2018 is an international standard that provides detailed guidelines for
information security risk management. It is part of the ISO/IEC 27000 family of
standards and is designed to support the implementation of ISO/IEC 27001 by
explaining how organizations can systematically identify, assess, treat, and monitor
risks. The objective of this standard is to protect information assets by ensuring
confidentiality, integrity, and availability while aligning with business goals and legal
requirements. The scope of ISO/IEC 27005 covers all organizational assets, including
people, processes, technology, data, and infrastructure. The risk management process
begins with establishing the context by defining scope, objectives, and risk appetite. It
then moves to risk assessment, which involves identifying assets, recognizing threats
such as hackers or malware, and evaluating vulnerabilities like weak passwords or
unpatched systems. Risks are analyzed using methods such as qualitative or
quantitative scoring, often represented through a likelihood–impact matrix, and then
evaluated against the organization’s tolerance levels. Based on this evaluation, risks
may be treated using different strategies, such as mitigating through technical controls,
transferring via insurance or outsourcing, avoiding by discontinuing risky activities, or
accepting if the risk falls within acceptable limits. After treatment, residual risks are
reassessed to ensure they are manageable. The standard also emphasizes the
importance of continuous monitoring, regular reviews, and effective communication of
risk results to stakeholders. By following ISO/IEC 27005, organizations can establish a
structured and consistent approach to managing information security risks, thereby
reducing potential losses, ensuring compliance with regulations, and increasing trust
among customers and partners.
### Q2 Perform an internal audit on user access control policies and identify any compliance violations.
Answer -
 The purpose of this internal audit is to evaluate the effectiveness of user access
control policies and identify any compliance violations that may pose risks to information
security and organizational compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 requirements.

characters).
○ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not applied to remote logins and privileged
accounts.
3. Access Provisioning & De-provisioning
○ Access rights are granted manually without proper approval workflow.
○ Delay in revoking access for transferred or terminated employees.
4. Privilege Management
○ Several users have been assigned admin rights without business justification.
○ Principle of least privilege is not followed consistently.
5. Monitoring & Logging
○ System activity logs exist but are not regularly reviewed by security staff.
○ Lack of automated alerts for suspicious or unauthorized access attempts.
6. Compliance Violations Identified
○ Non-compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 control A.9 (Access Control).
○ Violations of organizational policies regarding password strength and account
reviews.
○ Failure to ensure timely de-provisioning of users, increasing insider threat risk.

### Q1. Create an audit checklist for evaluating an organization’s compliance with PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard).
Answer -
 1. Build and Maintain a Secure Network
● Firewalls must be installed and configured properly to protect cardholder
data from unauthorized access. The audit should verify if firewall rules are
documented, reviewed, and up to date.
● Default vendor-supplied passwords and insecure settings (e.g.,
admin/admin) must be changed before system use. Weak configurations
are a major compliance violation.
2. Protect Cardholder Data
● Cardholder data must be encrypted during transmission across public
networks using secure protocols such as TLS. The audit should confirm
certificates are valid and encryption strength is sufficient.
● Stored cardholder data should be masked, truncated, or encrypted.
Sensitive authentication data (PINs, CVV) must never be stored after
authorization.
3. Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program
● Anti-virus or anti-malware software must be installed on all systems,
updated regularly, and actively running. The audit checks update
frequency and coverage.
● Security patches must be applied in a timely manner to all servers,
applications, and databases. Delayed patching leaves systems vulnerable
to known exploits.
4. Implement Strong Access Control Measures
● Access to cardholder data should follow the “least privilege” principle. Only
employees who require access for their job role should be allowed.
● Each user must have a unique ID to ensure accountability and traceability
of actions. Shared or generic accounts are not allowed.
● Physical access to systems storing cardholder data (servers, databases,
paper records) should be restricted using locks, ID cards, or biometric
systems.
5. Monitor and Test Networks
● Audit logs of system activity (login attempts, data access, configuration
changes) must be maintained and reviewed. Suspicious activities should
trigger alerts.
● Intrusion detection or prevention systems should be in place to monitor
network traffic. Regular vulnerability scans should be conducted by internal
teams and external auditors.
● Penetration tests should be carried out annually or after major system
changes to identify weaknesses.
6. Maintain an Information Security Policy
● A formal information security policy must exist, covering data protection,
acceptable use, and incident response. The audit checks if it aligns with
PCI DSS.
● Employees should receive security awareness training about handling
cardholder data and phishing risks. Training records should be reviewed.
● The policy must be reviewed at least annually and updated to reflect new
threats or compliance requirements
### Q2 Perform an internal audit of an organization’s payment processing systems for PCI DSS compliance.
Answer -
The purpose of this internal audit is to evaluate the organization’s payment
processing systems against the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standard) requirements. The audit ensures that cardholder data is adequately
protected, risks are minimized, and compliance obligations are met.
Audit Findings / Observations
1. Network Security:
○ Firewalls are in place but rules are not reviewed regularly.
○ Default vendor credentials were found on one payment server,
posing a compliance risk.
2. Cardholder Data Protection:
○ Data transmitted over public networks is encrypted with TLS, which
meets requirements.
○ However, cardholder data stored in backups is not encrypted,
violating PCI DSS.
3. Vulnerability Management:
○ Anti-virus is installed on all payment systems but not updated daily.
○ Security patches are sometimes delayed, leaving critical
vulnerabilities open.
4. Access Controls:
○ User IDs are assigned uniquely, but privilege reviews are not
conducted regularly.
○ Some employees have broader access than necessary (violation of
least privilege principle).
5. Monitoring and Logging:
● Transaction logs are enabled, but they are not reviewed consistently.
● Intrusion detection systems exist but are not tuned for payment-specific
threats.
6. Testing & Assessments:
● Vulnerability scans are performed quarterly as required.
● No penetration test has been conducted in the past year, which is a
compliance gap.
7. Security Policy:
● The organization has a security policy, but it has not been updated for the
last two years.
● Employee awareness training on PCI DSS is irregular and incomplete.
## slip 18
### Q1 Write a policy for securing personally identifiable information (PII) within an organization.
The purpose of this policy is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) collected, processed, and
stored by the organization. This protects individuals’ privacy and ensures
compliance with applicable data protection laws such as GDPR, CCPA, and local
regulations.
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service
providers who handle PII, including customer data, employee records, and
vendor information.
Policy Statements:
1. Data Collection:
○ PII shall only be collected for specific, lawful, and clearly defined
purposes.
○ Excessive or unnecessary data collection is prohibited.
2. Data Storage & Encryption:
○ All PII must be encrypted both at rest and in transit using industrystandard encryption protocols.
○ Physical storage (paper records) must be secured in locked cabinets
with restricted access.
3. Access Control:
○ Access to PII is granted on a “need-to-know” basis using RoleBased Access Control (RBAC).
○ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enabled for all systems
storing sensitive PII.
4. Data Sharing:
● PII must not be shared with unauthorized third parties.
● Any sharing with vendors must be governed by a Data Processing
Agreement (DPA).
5. Data Retention & Disposal:
● PII shall be retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill its purpose or
meet legal requirements.
● Data must be securely deleted (digital wiping or physical shredding) when
no longer needed.
6. Employee Responsibilities:
● Employees handling PII must complete privacy and data protection training
annually.
● Any suspected data breach must be reported immediately to the Data
Protection Officer (DPO).

● In case of a data breach, the organization will follow its Incident Response
Plan, including breach notification to regulators and affected individuals
within the required time frame.
8. Audits and Monitoring:
● Regular audits will be conducted to assess compliance with this policy.
● Monitoring tools will be used to detect unauthorized access or misuse of
PII.
### Q2 Conduct a PII audit to check how effectively the organization handles, stores, and protects sensitive data.
Answer -
The internal audit of the organization’s Personally Identifiable Information
(PII) practices revealed both strengths and areas of concern. The audit confirmed
that most customer and employee data is collected for valid business purposes
and that sensitive records are encrypted during storage and transmission.
However, it was observed that certain departments still maintain unnecessary
personal details beyond the required scope, which increases compliance risks.
Backup systems were also found to be partially secure, as some legacy data was
stored without proper encryption. Access controls are in place, but the absence
of regular privilege reviews allows some employees to retain access even after
role changes. Additionally, vendor management was highlighted as a weak area,
with some third-party partners processing PII without signed Data Processing
Agreements. The audit also noted that while training programs exist, employee
participation in annual privacy awareness sessions is inconsistent, and incident
response drills are not carried out regularly. Overall, the organization
demonstrates a reasonable level of data protection maturity, but improvements in
data minimization, backup security, vendor compliance, and employee training
are essential to ensure stronger compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and internal
privacy policies.
## slip 19

### Q2 Perform an audit of an organization’s healthcare data management practices for HIPAA compliance.
Answer
The audit reviewed how the organization manages Protected Health
Information (PHI). Policies for privacy and security exist, but not all employees
are trained regularly. Risk assessments are conducted, though some identified
vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated encryption) remain unaddressed. Access controls
are applied, but inactive accounts are not always removed promptly. Backup
systems are in place, but offsite data lacks full encryption. Business Associate
Agreements (BAAs) are signed with vendors, though some lack updated
compliance clauses. Incident response plans exist, but breach simulations are
not performed. Logging and monitoring are enabled, yet alerts are not reviewed
consistently. Physical security of server rooms is strong, but portable devices
(laptops, USBs) are weakly controlled. Overall, the organization is partially
compliant, but must improve encryption, access reviews, vendor management,
and staff training to fully align with HIPAA standards.
## slip 20
### Q1 Develop a secure password policy for an organization focusing on password complexity and expiration.
Answer -
To ensure strong password security by enforcing complexity requirements
and regular password expiration, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
1. Password Complexity Requirements
● Minimum Length: Passwords must be at least 12 characters long.
● Character Types: Passwords must include characters from at least four of the
following five categories:
● Uppercase letters (A-Z)
● Lowercase letters (a-z)
● Numbers (0-9)
● Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *)
● Unicode characters (if supported)
● Prohibited Elements:
● No use of easily guessable information such as username, real name, or
company name.
● No common passwords or dictionary words.
● No sequences or repeated characters (e.g., "12345", "aaaaaa").
● Password History: Users cannot reuse any of their last 5 passwords.
2. Password Expiration and Renewal
● Expiration Period: Passwords must be changed every 90 days.
● Notification: Users will receive reminders starting 10 days before password
expiration.
● Forced Change: After expiration, users must change their password before
accessing the system.
● Account Lockout: After 5 consecutive failed login attempts, the account will be
locked for 15 minutes or until reset by an administrator.
3. Additional Recommendations
● Encourage use of passphrases (a sequence of words) for easier
memorability and strength.
● Promote use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.
● Provide training and awareness on creating strong passwords and
recognizing phishing attempts.
### Q2 Audit the organization’s current password management practices and identify any vulnerabilities.
Answer -
To evaluate the existing password management policies and practices,
identify vulnerabilities, and recommend improvements to enhance security.
1. Review of Current Practices
● Password Complexity:
● Are there enforced rules on minimum length and character variety?
● Are users allowed to create weak or common passwords?
● Password Expiration:
● Is there a policy requiring periodic password changes?
● Are users notified before expiration?
● Password Storage:
● How are passwords stored? (e.g., hashed and salted, plaintext)
● Are secure hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) used?
● Password Sharing and Reuse:
● Are users discouraged or prevented from sharing passwords?
● Is password reuse across systems monitored or restricted?
● Account Lockout and Recovery:
● Are there mechanisms to lock accounts after multiple failed login
attempts?
● Is the password reset process secure (e.g., multi-factor verification)?
● User Awareness and Training:
● Are users trained on password best practices?
● Is there awareness about phishing and social engineering risks?
2. Identified Vulnerabilities
● Weak Passwords Allowed:
If complexity rules are lax or absent, users may choose easily guessable
passwords.
● Infrequent or No Password Expiration:
Passwords that never expire increase risk if compromised.
● Poor Password Storage:
Storing passwords in plaintext or using weak hashing algorithms exposes
credentials to theft.
● Lack of Account Lockout:
No lockout policy allows unlimited login attempts, increasing risk of brute-force
attacks.
● Insecure Password Reset Procedures:
Weak verification during resets can allow attackers to hijack accounts.
● Password Sharing and Reuse:
Users sharing passwords or reusing them across systems can lead to
widespread compromise.
● Insufficient User Training:
Users unaware of best practices may fall victim to phishing or use weak
passwords.
3. Recommendations
● Implement and enforce strong password complexity and expiration policies.
● Use secure password storage methods (hashed and salted with strong
algorithms).
● Enable account lockout after a limited number of failed attempts.
● Secure password reset processes with multi-factor authentication.
● Conduct regular user training on password security and phishing awareness.
● Monitor and prevent password reuse and sharing where possible.
